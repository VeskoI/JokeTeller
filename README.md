# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project
### Also known as Project 4 from [Udacity Android Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

The goal of this project is to create an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Could Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

### Some features of the finished app:

* Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
* Reusable functionality into a Java library
* Reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Used Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configured an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
